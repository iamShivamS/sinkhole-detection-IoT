*Sinkhole attack detection in IoT system*

This repository is part of Semester V Project Based Learning - Mini Project. Since all the work of project was done on Tinkercad. No external Files are attached in this repository.

In this Project, we have detected sinkhole attack on any one node using hierarchy based model. We have one Cluster Head node which takes data from sensor node and send it to cloud. As Sensor node have low computational power and less energy, so it can not perform heavy algorithms. So we have implemented Sinkhole detection algorithm on Cluster Head.
